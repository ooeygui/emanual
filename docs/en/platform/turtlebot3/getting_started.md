# [Getting Started](#getting-started)
This page is for users who are new to TurtleBot3. The manual has an enormous amount of content, but this page explains how information is divided.

## [About TurtleBot3](#about-turtlebot3)
First of all, collect information from the [Overview][overview], [Notices][notices], [Features][features], and [Specifications][specifications] pages to get an overall understanding of TurtleBot3.

## [First steps for using TurtleBot3](#first-steps-for-using-turtlebot3)
When you have enough understanding about TurtleBot3 from above step, here are the software and hardware setups. Be aware that it is a time-saver to set up the SBC and your PC first, rather than assembling the robot. It is recommended to proceed in the following order.

1. [PC Setup][pc_setup]: Install Linux or Windows, ROS and application software for TurtleBot3 on your **Remote PC**.
2. [SBC Setup][sbc_setup]: Install Linux or Windows, ROS and hardware related software to control the TurtleBot3 on your **TurtleBot PC**.
3. [OpenCR Setup][opencr_setup]: Upload latest firmware of TurtleBot3 to OpenCR embedded board.
4. [Hardware Setup][hardware_setup]: TurtleBots3 is delivered as unassembled parts in the box. Follow the instructions to assemble TurtleBot3. Prepared SBC and OpenCR will be mounted on the robot.

If you want to use other products instead of SBCs and Sensors included in the TurtleBot3 package, please refer to the [Compatible Devices][compatible_devices] page.

## [Let's try the basic operation](#lets-try-the-basic-operation)
Once you have completed the above steps, run the robot through the provided [Bringup][bringup] package, and remotely move the robot with the teleoperation feature.  
Next, let's check various sensors' value mounted on the robot or learn how to control the robot by reading [Basic Operation][basic_operation] page.

## [Keep TurtleBot3's various technologies with you](#keep-turtlebot3s-various-technologies-with-you)
The TurtleBot3’s core technology is [SLAM][slam], [Navigation][navigation] and [Manipulation][manipulation], making it suitable for home service robots. These technologies can be applied either on a real robot or a virtual robot with [Simulation][simulation] feature.  
Of course, they can be implemented in TurtleBot3, such as [Autonomous Driving][autonomous_driving] and [Machine Learning][machine_learning]. In addition, we are introducing 12 different types of [Locomotion][locomotion] as TurtleBot3 Friends, as well as differential drive mobile robot. With this openended component, handful of TurtleBot3 friends with various characteristics could be built. You can create a totally new robot that is never seen before. Also interesting applications such as Follower Demo, Panoramic Demo, and Automatic Parking are available. See [Applications][applications] page for more application examples.

## [Learn and Explore more](#learn-and-explore-more)
The above are just a few examples of using TurtleBot3. You can learn more and challenge yourself with the following information.

You can [Learn][learn] more through the ROS courses provided by the Construct, the various lectures created by TurtleBot3 users, web content, YouTube courses, free books, and more. In addition, various [Videos][videos] produced by ROBOTIS will be helpful, and use cases using TurtleBot3 can be checked through various [Projects][projects] released by TurtleBot3 research collaborators and TurtleBot3 users. You can also try a variety of challenges through [Challenges][challenges].
